      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        Experience an extraordinary experience in our 5-star accommodation with
        rooms and suites in the iconic plantation-style "Manor House" or widely
        spaced in separate luxurious Creole-style "villas" across beautifully
        landscaped gardens and along the beach. The soft colours and natural
        materials used in the rooms, combined with the tropical chic design,
        enhance the harmony of plantation elegance and timeless elegance.

              With the all inclusive program you can put your feet up and leave
              everything to us. We'll take care of the food, drink and
              entertainment. We just want you to enjoy your holiday. Every day
              you'll taste something new from the local cuisine. And there will
              be plenty to choose from. Of course, ice cream, chips and other
              "classics" for the kids will not be missed.
